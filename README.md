# Star Wars Chatbot!
You can ask this bot questions about Star Wars characters! It greets you asking if you want to talk about Star Wars (if you don't then why are you talking to this bot?!). 
The bot hits the Star Wars API (swapi.com) to pull characters that are in the Star Wars universe. If multiple characters could match, it presents you with those options to select from.
Once you've selected a character to talk about, it will present you with a list of information to show, then asks if you want to learn more and presents the options again.
